This project was created for my web development class,it has a professional template and consisting of 5 pages: Home, Sign In, Sign Up, Dashboard, and Add New Project. As my inaugural attempt at web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the site undoubtedly lacks certain elements.


The most important thing to me about this website is how it looks and feels. Even after 8 months, I still think the design and user experience are really good when I look at it again.
This project's pages and web map are not completed yet
